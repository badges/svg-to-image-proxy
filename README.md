Web function to generate PNGs from SVGs. Based on [convert-svg-to-png][]
which uses headless Chromium.

The proxy accepts a request for e.g. `https://raster.example.com/example.png`
and translates it to a request for
`https://other-server.example.com/example.svg`. If the path doesn't contain
`.png`, it passes is unchanged, e.g. `https://raster.example.com/example` to
`https://other-server.example.com/example`.

The query string is also forwarded upstream. Cache headers are forwarded downstream.

The host comes from the `BASE_URL` environment variable.

Designed for [Shields][] though may be useful for other application as well.
